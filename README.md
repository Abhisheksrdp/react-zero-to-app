# üç¥ Food Ordering App - Learning React by Building Real Projects

Welcome! This project is part of my journey to master frontend development, especially React.js. Every day, I improve this app and learn new concepts in JavaScript, React, and web development.

## Project Overview

A responsive food ordering web app that fetches and displays restaurant data with images, ratings, cuisines, and estimated delivery time. This is built using React and styled using modern CSS. The data is structured to simulate API calls with complex JSON.
